# data-i-guess

Data-i-guess is where I share the generated code related to my open access data visualisations published on https://data-i-guess.tumblr.com

This project is personal, hence, I visualize data that I find funny|interetsting|disturbing (usually related to weird things people do since I am into sociology) and while doing so I get better at coding. I use mostly Python but sometimes R.
